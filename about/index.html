			<p>First year Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the Bioengineering program with a home school in Electrical and Computer Engineering. </p>
			<p>Attended Washington University in St. Louis for my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering with minors in computer science and robotics. I worked in the Brain Dynamics and Control
			Research Group under Dr. ShiNung Ching where I developed a real-time transcranial current stimulation platform and algorithms for a basic neural control system. In addition to an honors thesis
			produced for this lab I completed a capstone that can be found <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/racecar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></p>
			<p>Alumni of the Stream-Based Supercomputing Lab where I worked under Dr. Jeremy Buhler and Dr. Roger Chamberlain to improve the performance of a gamma-ray burst localization
			algorithm for a novel space telescope application by 300%. My work in this lab resulted in first authorship in a publication entitled "Supporting Multi-messenger Astrophysics with Fast 
			Gamma-ray Burst Localization. </p>
