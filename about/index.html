			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am a current senior at Washington University in St. Louis majoring in electrical engineering with minors in computer science and robotics. I work in the Neural Dynamics and Control
			Research Group under Dr. ShiNung Ching where I am developing a real-time transcranial current stimulation platform and developing algorithms for a neural control system. I hope to 
			continue on to graduate school in the pursuit of a PhD in biomedical engineering, ideally working on neural prosthetic systems.</p>
			<p>I am an alumni of the Stream-Based Supercomputing Lab where I worked under Dr. Jeremy Buhler and Dr. Roger Chamberlain to improve the performance of a gamma-ray burst localization
			algorithm for a novel space telescope application by 300%. My work in this lab resulted in first authorship in a publication entitled "Supporting Multi-messenger Astrophysics with Fast 
			Gamma-ray Burst Localization. </p>
			<p>In my free time I am the drummer for the band Faced Out and the Bassist and Vocalist for the band Dole's Fruit Company. In addition to just playing music, I also enjoy its technical
			aspects while building guitar pedals as a hobbyist electronics engineer.</p>
