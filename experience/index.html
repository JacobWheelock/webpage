				<h4>January 2022 - May 2023</h4>
				<h3>Brain Dynamics and Control Research Group</h3>
				<p>During the spring of 2022 I completed my <a href="Honors_Thesis_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honors thesis</a> under Dr. ShiNung Ching by developing a real-time transcranial 
				stimulation platform from the ground-up beginning with prototyping on a breadboard and eventually creating and printing a PCB to house the platform. The following summer I was funded under a Research
				Experience for Undergraduates (REU) grant to develop a pilot experimental paradigm for the platform to verify its efficacy. Our findings were then presented the following spring at the NER 2023
				conference. At this conference I presented a <a href="Poster.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scientific poster</a> detailing the electronic specifications of the stimulator and the most
					recent experiment run.
				</p>

				<h4>January 2021 - April 2022</h4>
				<h3>Stream-Based Supercomputing Lab</h3>
				<p>During my time in the SBS lab, I used the programming language CUDA to parallelize the Compton-scattering reconstruction algorithm and allow it run on a GPU. This work resulted in a first-authorship on
					a publication that I spoke about at the Urgent HPC workshop at Supercomputing 2021. Following this, I worked on developing novel ways to quickly and accurately cluster gamma-ray burst events in a different
					part of the same Compton-scattering reconstruction pipeline.

				<h4>January 2022 - May 2023</h4>
				<h3>Assistant Instructor at Washington University in St. Louis</h3>
				<p>As an assistant instructor for various classes I led recitation sections, gave office hours, graded, and created assignments. I have worked to develop several projects for ESE 351 - Signals and
				Systems and have also developed a great deal of material for the recitation sections for this class. During my time at WashU I was an assistant instructor for ESE 351 - Signals and Systems, ESE
				330 - Engineering Electromagnetic Principles, ENGR 326 - Engineering Statistics with Probability, ESE 498 - Electrical Engineering Capstone Design, and ESE 331 - Electronics Laboratory.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>August 2019 - January 2022</h4>
				<h3>Teaching Assistant at Washington University in St. Louis</h3>
				<p>As a teaching assistant, I hosted office hours for students in order to help them better understand the material they were learning. I was a teaching assistant for ESE 362 - Computer Architecture, ESE 
				260 - Introduction to Digital Logic and Computer Design and CSE 131 - Introduction to Computer Science. </p>
