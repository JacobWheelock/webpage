				<h4>January 2022 - Ongoing</h4>
				<h3>Neural Dynamics and Control Research Group</h3>
				<p>During the spring of 2022 I completed my <a href="Honors_Thesis_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honors thesis</a> under Dr. ShiNung Ching by developing a real-time transcranial 
				stimulation platform from the ground-up beginning with prototyping on a breadboard and eventually creating and priting a PCB to house the platform. I now work on using this platform to develop a 
				closed-loop neural feedback system in the pursuit of better understanding the effects of electrical stimulation on working memory. </p>
				<br>
				<h4>January 2021 - April 2022</h4>
				<h3>Stream-Based Supercomputing Lab</h3>
				<p>During my time in the SBS lab, I used the programming language CUDA to parallelize the Compton-scattering reconstruction algorithm and allow it run on a GPU. This work resulted in a first-authorship on 					publication and I spoke at the Urgent HPC workshop at Supercomputing 2021 to deliever my findings. Following this, I worked on developing novel ways to quickly and accurately cluster gamma-ray burst
				   events in a different part of the same Compton-scattering reconstruction pipeline.</p>

				<h4>January 2022 - Ongoing</h4>
				<h3>Assistant Instructor</h3>
				<p>As an assistant instructor for various classes I have led recitation sections, given office hours, graded, and created assignments. I have worked to develop several projects for ESE 351 - Signals and
				Systems and have also developed a great deal of material for the recitation sections for this class. During this upcoming semester I will be an assistant instructor for ESE 351 - Signals and Systems, ESE 
				330 - Engineering Electromagnetic Principles and ENGR 328 - Engineering Statistics with Probability.</p>		
				<br>
				<h4>August 2019 - January 2022</h4>
				<h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
				<p>As a teaching assistant, I hosted office hours for students in order to help them better understand the material they were learning. I was a teaching assistant for ESE 362 - Computer Architecture, ESE 
				260 - Introduction to Digital Logic and Computer Design and CSE 131 - Introduction to Computer Science. </p>
				<br>
				<h4>August 2020 - December 2021</h4>
				<h3>Problem Solving Team Leader</h3>
				<p>In order to encourage success for new students in the department, ESE 105 - Introduction to Electrical and Systems Engineering created problem solving team sessions led by students
				who had previously been successful in the class to summarize the previous week's material and help students solve challenging problems involving said material. I served as a problem solving team leader
				for two semesters and worked with one group of students for each semester, allowing them to become more familar with the department and the material.</p>
